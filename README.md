# BaseballOpticsAnalysis

### Project Overview
BaseballOpticsAnalysis is a machine learning project analyzing pitch-level optical tracking data from college baseball games. Using a dataset of 3,344 observations from TrackMan V3, this project visualizes pitches within the strike zone and classifies them as "balls" or "strikes." The objective is to leverage machine learning techniques to gain insights into pitch placement and classification accuracy.

### Dataset
The `Track_Combo.csv` dataset includes pitch tracking data from 21 college baseball scrimmage games. Each observation provides detailed information on pitch type, count, and trajectory, recorded by TrackMan V3. Player and team IDs have been anonymized. For further details, see the [TrackMan glossary](https://support.trackmanbaseball.com/hc/en-us/articles/5089413493787-V3-FAQs-Radar-Measurement-Glossary-Of-Terms).
